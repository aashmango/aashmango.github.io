<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Aashman, a Product Designer based in NYC. 
    I currently work at <a href="https://www.palantir.com">Palantir</a>, where I help create 
    user experiences that empower large organizations 
    to ask complex questions of their data. Previously, 
    I worked at <a href="https://www.formlabs.com">Formlabs</a> in Cambridge, 
    MA, where I designed hardware interfaces & 3D models. 
    In 2016, I earned my degree in architecture from <a href="https://www.risd.edu">RISD</a>. Get in touch via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aashmangoghari/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:aashman.g@gmail.com">email</a>.
